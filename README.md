## Motivation

The goal of this project is to learn go and provide a solution to my problem, that I am missing a program to display multimedia files with separate subtitle tracks.

## How the streaming works

To enable the user to navigate through content in the used media player, the idea of _partial content (206)_ is used:
If a file just gets flushed to the client, then the client has to wait to receive the whole file, before playing it and enabling the user to navigate through it.
Instead of that, the client requests a byte range of the file and gets these bytes served.
Before the buffer of the client runs out, a request with the next byte range is sent.

## Used technologies

This project ist contains a frontend and a backend with their own technology stack

## Frontend

- React
- Ant Design
- TanStack Router

## Backend

- Go

## Technological Requirements

- Node 20
- Go 1.22

## Configuration

## How to develop

### How to debug the player

```javascript
const player = document.querySelector("video");
const events = [
  "abort",
  "canplay",
  "canplaythrough",
  "durationchange",
  "emptied",
  "encrypted",
  "ended",
  "error",
  "interruptbegin",
  "interruptend",
  "loadeddata",
  "loadedmetadata",
  "loadstart",
  "mozaudioavailable",
  "pause",
  "play",
  "playing",
  "progress",
  "ratechange",
  "seeked",
  "seeking",
  "stalled",
  "suspend",
  "timeupdate",
  "volumechange",
  "waiting",
];
events.forEach((a) =>
  player.addEventListener(a, (e) => console.log(e.type, e))
);
```

## Docker

The app can be run by using docker.
The frontend and the backend run in separate containers.

### Backend

While running the container these environment variables have to be set:

| Variable     | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                    | Example               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ALLOWED_CORS | The cors (separated by comma) that are allowed while serving content. Using a wildcard allows all origins to access the resource                                                         | http://localhost:4200 |
| ROOT_PATH    | The path to the folder that contains the content that should be served bz the server. Beware, that the folder has to be accessible by the container using the -v (volume flag) of docker | /Temp                 |
| HOST_ADDRESS | Address that should be used to host the server. Use 0.0.0.0 while running the server in docker                                                                                           | 0.0.0.0               |
| HOST_PORT    | The port that should be used to host the server                                                                                                                                          | 3000                  |

Example:

```bash
docker build . --target videos-with-subtitle-player_backend --tag videos-with-subtitle-player_backend:latest

# While running in docker HOST_ADDRESS has to be 0.0.0.0 to enable the server to listen to incoming requests
# Mapping the volume of the host to the container is required -v <host>:<container> - ROOT_PATH=<container>
docker run -v C:/Temp:/Temp -p 3000:3000 -e ALLOWED_CORS=http://localhost:4200 -e ROOT_PATH=/Temp -e HOST_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 -e HOST_PORT=3000 videos-with-subtitle-player_backend
```

### Frontend

While building the frontend these environment variables have to be set:

| Variable      | Usage                  | Example               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| VITE_BASE_URL | The url of the backend | http://localhost:3000 |

Example:

```bash
docker build . --target videos-with-subtitle-player_frontend --tag videos-with-subtitle-player_frontend:latest --build-arg VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# to use nginx the port inside the container has to be 80
docker run -p 4200:80 videos-with-subtitle-player_frontend
```
